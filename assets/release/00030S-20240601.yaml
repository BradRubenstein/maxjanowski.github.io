  כֹּ֣ה ׀ אָמַ֣ר יְהֹוָ֗ה:

  ק֣וֹל בְּרָמָ֤ה נִשְׁמָע֙
  נְהִי֙ בְּכִ֣י תַמְרוּרִ֔ים

  Koh  a-mar A-do-nai:

  Kol be-ra-mah nish-ma
  ne-hi be-chi tam-ru-rim
  Ra-chel me-vak-kah al-ba-<strong>nei</strong>-ha 
  me-’a-nah le-hin-na-chem al-ba-<strong>nei</strong>-ha

translation: |-
  Thus says the LORD:

  A voice is heard in Ramah, 
  Lamentation, and bitter weeping, 
  Rachel weeping for her children;
  She refuses to be comforted for her children, 
  Because they are no more.
