translation:
  " He had a dream; a stairway was set on the ground and its top reached
  to the sky, and messengers of God were going up and down on it. And standing beside
  him was Adonai, who said, “I am Adonai, the God of your father Abraham’s [house] and the God of Isaac’s [house]: the ground on which you are lying I will assign
  to you and to your offspring.”"
