title: Two Psalms of Comfort and Consolation
author: by Max Janowski
edited: edited by Cantor Cory Winter and Jordan Goodman
blurb: 
  Two beautiful compositions — Adonai Roi is a setting of Psalm 23, “The Lord is my shepherd.”
  Its pastoral music complements the text. This folio includes arrangements for
  use with or without piano accompaniment. 
  The second selection, Esa Eynai, is a setting of Psalm 121, “I will lift my eyes.” 
  By contrast, it is composed in a more stately, “maestoso” style.
