translation:
  " Hallelujah. Praise God in His sanctuary; praise Him in the sky, His
  stronghold. Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him for His exceeding greatness.
  Praise Him with blasts of the horn; praise Him with harp and lyre. Praise Him with
  timbrel and dance; praise Him with lute and pipe. Praise Him with resounding cymbals;
  praise Him with loud-clashing cymbals. Let all that breathes praise the LORD. Hallelujah. "
