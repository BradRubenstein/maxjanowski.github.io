translation: |-
  Listen to Me, you who pursue justice, you who seek the Lord.
  Look to the rock you were hewn from, to the quarry you were dug from.

  Look back to Abraham your father and to Sarah who brought you forth.
  For he was only one when I called him, but I blessed him and made him many.
