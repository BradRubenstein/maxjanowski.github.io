    "translation": "Grant peace, goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Yisrael, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your eyes and to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace. In the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Yisrael for a good life and peace. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who makes the peace.<br/>— The Metsudah Machzor.  Metsudah Publications, New York (CC-BY)",
