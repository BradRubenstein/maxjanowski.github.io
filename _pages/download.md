# Music Editions

The Max Janowski Society is producing new editions of Janowski's music,
which we will be making available in the summer of 2022. They are designed
especially for cantors, cantorial soloists, Jewish synagogue choirs, and anyone
who loves Jewish music.

If you want to hear when they become available, sign up for our [mailing list](/subscribe). If you would like to help us create and distribute these new editions, please consider making a [donation](/donate).

## How To Download Our New Editions

For each of the Max Janowski compositions in our catalog, we have created
performance packages that contain tools for your performers:

* Sheet music in one or more keys.
* Audio files of the piece for rehearsal preparation, including audio that highlights each choral part.

Once you have downloaded a performance packet, we encourage you to share it
with your performers (you don't need to buy a copy for each person).

If you'd like early access to the entire catalog containing ***all*** these
editions, please become a [platinum supporter](/platinum)!

## Instructions

We distribute these packages from Google Drive. You'll need a Google account to download them. If you have any problems, [contact us](/contact).
