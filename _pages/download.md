# How To Download Our New Editions

For each of the Max Janowski compositions in our catalog, we have created
performance packages that contain tools for your performers:

* Sheet music in one or more keys.
* Audio files of the piece for rehearsal preparation, including audio that highlights each choral part.

Once you have downloaded a performance packet, we encourage you to share it
with your performers (you don't need to buy a copy for each person).

If you'd like early access to the entire catalog containing ***all*** these
editions, please become a [platinum supporter](/platinum)!

# Instructions

We distribute these packages from Google Drive. You'll need a Google account to download them. If you have any problems, [contact us](/contact).

Pick the piece you are interested in.
