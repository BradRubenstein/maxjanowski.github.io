# Music Editions

From the list below, you can see the compositions we have available for download.

The Max Janowski Society is producing new editions of Janowski's music. They are designed
especially for cantors, cantorial soloists, Jewish synagogue choirs, and anyone
who loves Jewish music.

If you want to hear when new editions become available, sign up for our [mailing list]({% link _pages/4_subscribe.md %}). If you would like to help us create and distribute these new editions, please consider making a [donation]({% link _pages/3_donate.md %}).

## How To Download Our New Editions

For each of the Max Janowski compositions in our catalog, we have created
performance packages that contain tools for your performers:

* Sheet music in one or more keys.
* Audio files of the piece for rehearsal preparation, including audio that highlights each choral part.

Once you have downloaded the files, we encourage you to share them
with your performers (you don't need to buy a copy for each person).

If you'd like early access to the entire catalog containing ***all*** these
editions, please become a [platinum supporter]({% link _pages/platinum.md %})!

## Instructions

We distribute these packages from Google Drive. You'll need a Google account to download them. If you have any problems or questions, [contact us]({% link _pages/5_contact.md %}).
