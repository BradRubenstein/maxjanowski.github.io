# Welcome

The mission of the Max Janowski Society is to increase audiences
and enthusiasm for the music of Max Janowski (1912-1991); to
collect, catalog, distribute, adapt, and publish new editions
of Max Janowski’s music; to educate performers, scholars, and
the general public about Janowski’s musical legacy; and to
be the primary resource for information and discussion about
Janowski’s scores, recordings and publications.

We are excited about the many ways in which we are promoting
Max’s legacy and grateful to our friends who are helping to
make them happen.

We are just getting started.
