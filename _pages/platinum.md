# Become a Platinum Sponsor Today

Individuals and institutions that are inspired, as we are, by our mission
to create new and useful performance editions of Max's music, are invited to
join us.

For a donation of $250 or more, you become a **Platinum Sponsor** for a year.

Your contribution allows us to create and distribute new recordings and editions
of Max Janowski's music, including both sheet music and audio tracks to assist
in choral performance preparation.

We are pleased to share with our Platinum Sponsors:

- Early access to all the solo and choral editions in our catalog for you to perform.
- Our Platinum Newsletter, alerting you to new editions as they are made available, and events at which TMJS is presenting our music.
- We also gratefully acknowledge sponsors on our [Thank You]({% link _pages/thanks.md %}) page.

## Platinum Sponsor Access Portal

If you are already a platinum sponsor, you can access our catalog [here]({% link _pages/platinum-downloads-redirect.md %}){:target="\_blank"}. It is hosted on Google Drive, so you'll need a Google account if you don't already have one. For any questions about finding or accessing scores,
[contact us]({% link _pages/5_contact.md %}).
