For each of the Max Janowski compositions in our library, we have created
performance packages that contain tools for your performers:

* Sheet music in one or more keys
* Audio files of the piece, including audio that highlights each choral part

Once you have downloaded a performance packet, we encourage you to share it
with your performers (you don't need to buy a copy for each person).

# Instructions

* Click on a link below.
* Log in to your Google account
* Click the "Request Access" button (if you don't already have access)
* Download the entire package by clicking the download icon.
