# Donate

Thank you for joining us in supporting the Max Janowski Society. We truly
appreciate your generosity. Contributions will be used to develop and promote
the music of Max Janowski, and to help underwrite new editions, performances,
and recordings.

Your tax-deductible contribution is an important act in the ongoing work to
preserve and raise awareness of these jewels of Jewish-American musical history
and tradition.
